# Feed Reader Testing project

This project was created as a part of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## About this project

Using the Behavior Driven Development testing framework Jasmine, I wrote a number of tests against a provided RSS feed reader application. These tests concern the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## How to run the application

In order to run the application, clone this repository to your computer using the `$ git clone` command and open `index.html` in your browser. Alternatively you can download [this zip file](https://github.com/klobuli/udacity-feed-reader-testing/archive/master.zip) or view the project [directly on GitHub](https://klobuli.github.io/udacity-feed-reader-testing/).
